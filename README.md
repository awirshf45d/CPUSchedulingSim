# CPUSchedulingSim

**CPUSchedulingSim** is a Python-based CPU scheduling simulator that visualizes and compares the execution of various scheduling algorithms. It includes support for algorithms like **FCFS**, **SPN**, **HRRN**, **RR**, and **SRTF**. You can input your own processes, adjust parameters like context switch time and time quantum, and get both visual Gantt charts and tabular metrics (e.g., waiting time, turnaround time, response time).

## Features ✨

- Simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
  - **Shortest Process Next (SPN)**
  - **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**
  - **Round Robin (RR)**
  - **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**

- Provides Gantt chart visualizations for each algorithm
- Displays detailed process metrics: wait time, turnaround time, and response time
- Customizable time quantum and context switch time
